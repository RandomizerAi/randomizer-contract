# Randomizer Protocol VRF

https://randomizer.ai

Randomizer is a decentralized random value generation protocol that uses native ETH for fees, with real-time results, built in Solidity for EVM chains. It uses elliptic curve cryptography with verifiable random functions (VRF) to send callbacks with random values to smart contracts in a trustless and verifiable manner.

Randomizer uses a mix of future block data, progressive random beacon selection, elliptic curve cryptography, and a staking system to provide a stable solution for verifiable random values to smart contracts.

The protocol also offers a unique **real-time results** module that sends results to your front-end immediately after the user transaction is verified and before a callback is made on-chain. This way you can build responsive and real-time dapps and games.

See [Real-time Coinflip Game Demo](https://coinflip.randomizer.ai/)  ([source](https://github.com/RandomizerAi/coinflip-example)) for an example game.

The real-time module npm package is [@randomizer.ai/realtime-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@randomizer.ai/realtime-client).

## Features

- **Native ETH for fees**: Smart contracts (or their users) pay for request fees using ETH. This eliminates all additional gas costs and fluctuations that come from dealing with ERC20 tokens, approvals, and swaps.
- **Low cost**: VRF fees are intended to always be low cost relative to the network's average fees.
- **Decentralized**: Beacons are operated by independent projects and developers.
- **Real-time**: Integrate the the real-time client in your front-end and get instant results after your contract's request, even before callback transactions are verified on-chain.
- **Transparent**: Random value generation is verified on-chain with all data publicly available, including the random value, the VRF proofs, and the fulfilling beacons.
- **Proof of Stake**: Beacons stake ETH for their position. If a beacon misses a request, their ETH stake is slashed for the collective fees already paid for the request, plus a reward to the caller of the Renew function. If they miss 3 out of 99 requests, the beacon is automatically unregistered from the protocol.
- **Unpredictable**: a request's final beacon is selected using a seed generated with the VRF data of two previous pseudo-randomly selected beacons, and future block data. This new seed is then used by the randomly selected final beacon to generate the final VRF data for the result.

## Getting Started

Visit [https://randomizer.ai/docs](https://randomizer.ai/docs) for a step-by-step tutorial on using Randomizer with your smart contract or web3 project.

Your contract needs to have the function `randomizerCallback(uint256 _id, bytes32 _value)` to accept callbacks from Randomizer.

Make sure that the only permitted `msg.sender` for the callback function is the Randomizer contract address.

**Example coinflip:**

```JS
interface IRandomizer {
    function request(uint256 callbackGasLimit) external returns (uint256);
}

function flip() external returns (uint256) {
    // request(callbackGasLimit)
    uint256 flip = Randomizer.request(500000);
    flipToAddress[flip] = msg.sender;
}

function randomizerCallback(uint256 _id, bytes32 _value) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(Randomizer));
    address player = flipToAddress[_id];
    // Convert the random bytes to a number between 0 and 99
    uint256 random = uint256(_value) % 99;
    // 50% win/lose
    if(random >= 50){
      emit Win(player);
    } else {
      emit Lose(player);
    }
}
```

### Smart Contract Functions

Below are some important Randomizer functions for your dapp:

- `request(callbackGasLimit)`: Makes a request for a random value and returns the request ID.
- `request(callbackGasLimit, confirmations)`: Makes a request for a random value (with a callback after a number of block confirmations, max 40), and returns the request ID.
- `estimateFee(callbackGasLimit)`: Estimates the fee for a request given a callback gas limit.
- `estimateFee(callbackGasLimit, confirmations)`: Estimates the fee for a request given a callback gas limit with confirmations.
- `estimateFeeUsingGasPrice(callbackGasLimit, gasPrice)`: Estimates the fee for a request given a callback gas limit and gas price (usable for front-ends).
- `estimateFeeUsingConfirmationsAndGasPrice(callbackGasLimit, confirmations, gasPrice)`: Estimates the fee for a request given a callback gas limit, confirmations, and gas price (usable for front-ends).
- `getFeeStats(requestID)`: Returns the total amount paid and refunded for a request (handy if your users pay for requests and you want your contract to refund the remainder).
- `clientDeposit(address) payable`: Deposit attached ETH (`msg.value`) to Randomizer for the client contract. You can combine this with `estimateFee(callbackGasLimit)` to have your users attach the ETH fee themselves for the VRF request ([read more](https://randomizer.ai/docs#withdrawing)).
- `clientWithdrawTo(address, amount)`: Integrate this function in your smart contract to withdraw deposited ETH from Randomizer to the designated address.

### Development

The quickest way to test your smart contract's `randomizerCallback()` function in Hardhat or another local testing environment, is to utilize the RandomizerDummy contract.
See the [CoinFlip monorepo](https://github.com/RandomizerAi/coinflip-example) for a full example with hardhat tests.

1. Get the DummyRandomizer contract [here](https://github.com/RandomizerAi/coinflip-example/blob/main/contracts/DummyRandomizer.sol)
2. In your test environment, deploy the dummy contract, then deploy your contract with the DummyRandomizer address as the Randomizer address.
3. Call your requesting function (e.g. `mint()` or `play()`) to make a request for a random number.
4. Call `dummyRandomizer.submitRandom(uint256 id, bytes32 value)` with the request id (starts at 1) and any value, and it will callback to your contract.

### Using this Hardhat project

To use this Hardhat project, git clone it and run `yarn set-network:[network]` (`ethereum`, `arbitrum`, or `generic`) to copy the correct network library (for gas/block calculations) from `network-contracts` to `contracts`. For example: `yarn set-network:ethereum`.

Tests will only pass 100% if the network is set to ethereum since some tests utilize EIP-1559 (a fee system not present in arbitrum).

See the tests for reference.
